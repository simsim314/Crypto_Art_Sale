# Crypto_Sell_CA_Art
A visual art based on Conway's game of life being sold as crypto real estate, by creator of the art piece.

Hello my name is Michael Simkin and I wrote the search tool and discovered the [P120 Simkin Gun](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Simkin_glider_gun). In this project I want to promote the Art sell of this discovery based on crypto technology (in order to promote cellular automata as well as blockchain technologies research). Please read the white paper for wider perspective on ideology and working plan for this project.

[Oscillator P120](Oscillator_P120.jscad) file is [OpenJscad](https://openjscad.org/) file where you can paste the code and run to see the state of the real estate art, and the people to whom it belongs. Later on I'll write a smart contract to manage transaction more robustly, decetralized and private (more later on we will make a [decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) analog). 

[P120_golly_script.py](P120_golly_script.py) is the python script in [golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/) made to generate the [get_arr()](Oscillator_P120.jscad#L6) function of the oscillator sctipt, and should remain immutable unleas the DAO will decide otherwise for some reason.
